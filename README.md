Welcome to my Github repository where I showcase my data science projects. 
In this repo, you will find a collection of my completed projects ranging from exploratory data analysis to machine learning models. 
Each project includes a detailed explanation of the problem, data, approach, and results, as well as the code used to complete the project. 
Through these projects, I demonstrate my skills in data wrangling, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning. 
Whether you're a data science enthusiast or a hiring manager looking for a skilled data scientist, my Github repository is the perfect place to explore my work and see my skills in action.
